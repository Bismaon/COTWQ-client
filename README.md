# Countries of the World Quizzes
## Description
This is a React-based web application. It includes a structured frontend with essential React components, and static assets. The project is only designed by me. It is a small scale project and not made for scalability.  I have been working on this project for a while now and have always aimed to make the code readable and structured, however I am aware there are some improvements possible, and would gladly take them. :)

Across the app you will be able to play various quiz ranging from countries name to their language,
capital, flag, etc. You can create an account and login to keep track of your times, these times are also accessible via the Highscores button. The app is also available in french however lots of translation are wrong or not updated.
## Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Bismaon/COTWQ-client.git
   cd COTWQ-client
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

## Running the Application
Start the development server:
```sh
npm start
```

This will launch the React app on `http://localhost:3000/`.

## Building for Production
To create an optimized production build:
```sh
npm run build
```

This will generate a `build/` folder with the minified assets.

## Pushing
To push the content of the build folder to the server directory:
```sh
npm run push
```
